we want to create a FastAPI-based system for detecting YouTube sponsorships using video descriptions, we will subscribe to PubSubHubbub to receive notifications when new videos are published. The system will then use the YouTube Data API to fetch video details and extract the description.The system will analyze the description to determine if the video is sponsored or not. If not sponsored, the system will discard it. If sponsored, it will identify the sponsor using description and keyword analysis.
